#variables

a = 2 #memory address 0x0001
b = 3 #memory address 0x0002
c = a+b #memory address 0x0003
a = 1
b = 10
print(c)


#python put 2,3 and the result of c in the memory of computer
#memory address is not human friendly, so we made the variable kinda lable
#we can also make another varisbles from other variables
#python code from top to bottom

#variable allows you to hold the value, also give the name of the value even thougth it
#is actually a memory address
